### Reworded and Improved Version:

**Privilege Escalation Check Using Nessus Audit File**  
This process involves leveraging a Nessus audit file to assess a target server for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The check identifies misconfigurations or weaknesses that could be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. Such assessments are crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of the server.

**Automating Privilege Checks**  
To automate the privilege escalation checking process, use the following steps to build and deploy the application:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t php-audit-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8181:80 --restart=always --name audit-app php-audit-app
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:  
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8181` to interact with the application.
